# Happy Village Game
 A simulation 10*10 grid game where disasters can happen and the player should solve them.

## Overview
 In our game we have a 10*10 grid and on this grid we may have a building or a citizen. Citizens can also be found inside the building. We also have 5 units which are responsible for fixing certain disasters. This game highlights the 4 main concepts of Object Oriented Programming; Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism. 

## Starting the Game
 To start the game, open the workspace in your IDE. Find the StartView class from the Views package and run the main method found there.

### How to play?
 After running the StartView class, the grid is shown also the 5 units. To simulate time passing press the "Next Cycle" button found in the top middle of the game. When time passes, a disaster might happen and it will should on the grid and in the logs. For example a fire disaster happening on a building would result the background of this building to go red and to solve this disaster press on the fire truck and then building, by doing so a new button "RESPOND TO" will appear and by pressing this button the unit is assigned to that building.
